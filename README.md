# CityWoods
Created during "GREEN-A-THON" at Rajasthan Digifest ,Bikaner 2018

#CityWoods is not just a Tech solution providing a platform to help save Earth by planting Trees. It is the ordinary people extraordinarily determined to protect the environment not just by themselves, but also by sensitizing others towards the importance of environment conservation and goading them on to participate in tree-plantation campaigns.

#"CityWoods" is a one-stop solution for people who are willing to contribute to the cause by not even wasting their time there are volunteers performing tasks for them, And there is more it gets better when we connect tree plantation and sustainable income. "Fruit tree plantations". Where farmers will have fruit trees in their land and they can have a source of income by selling fruits. So far 40 fruit saplings have been planted with 3 farmers of Alwar district. This was a pilot project and has been successful . We will now replicate the same in many more villages across the country.
